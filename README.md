# weather_data_automation
Python scripts to grab useful weather data.

Run these scripts using [this Docker image.](github.com/jweisbaum/weather-and-gis-docker)  

These scripts and data sources are meant to help ocean navigators prepare for offshore races.  

Be advised: these scripts are used at your own risk, and I take no responsibility for any issues arrising from using them to navigate. 
- There are no formal testing or validation procedures in place.  
- It is possible that a script:
    - Bricks your computer,  
    - Messes up your Expedition log,  
    - Downloads so much data that your computer becomes slow,  
    - Downloads so much data that your satellite internet bill is astronomical,  
    - Gives you the wrong information, such as an outdated location or heading,  
    - Gets your IP banned from a weather data server,
    - Has some other bug that makes you have a really bad day in an unforseen way.  

I am not responsible for any of the above, though I am developing these for my own purposes.  Please take the time to understand these scripts before you use them or alter them for your needs.
